        <name>Is Trump Really That Racist?</name>
        <description>We know his rhetoric has been described as boundary breaking when it comes to race. But U.S. presidents have been enacting racist policies forever. So as President Trump wraps up his first (and maybe only) term in office, we're asking: In terms of racism, how does he stack up to others when it comes to both words and deeds?</description>

        <description>The VP candidate's biography and heritage allow people to project all kinds of ideas onto her, and to see what they want to see. But Kamala Harris's identity is a very important lens into not just her own politics, but also Black politics around crime and punishment more broadly. </description>

        <name>Hip-Hop, Mass Incarceration, And A Conspiracy Theory For The Ages</name>
        <description>Why are hip-hop and mass incarceration so entangled in the U.S.? That's the question that our play cousins at NPR Music, Sidney Madden and Rodney Carmichael, set out to answer on &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510357/louder-than-a-riot"&gt;their brand new podcast, &lt;em&gt;Louder Than a Riot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

        <name>A Treaty Right For Cherokee Representation</name>
        <description>On this week's episode of Code Switch, we talk about the relevance of a 200 year old treaty — one that most Americans don't know that much about, but should. It's a treaty that led to the Trail of Tears, but also secured a tenuous promise.</description>

        <name>A New Look For The Fashion Industry?</name>
        <description>Fall is the time for glossy fashion magazines, full of dazzling looks and the seasons hottest looks. But this year, we noticed something unusual: The covers of a bunch of major magazines fashion magazines featured Black folks. So we called up fashion critic Robin Givhan to talk about fashion's racial reckoning...and how long before it goes out of style.</description>

        <name>Is It Time To Say R.I.P. To 'POC'?</name>
        <description>Suffice it to say, we use the term "POC" a lot on Code Switch. But critiques of the initialism — and the popularization of the term "BIPOC" — caused us to ask: Should we retire POC? Or is there use in it yet?</description>

        <name>Battle Of The Books</name>
        <description>The Code Switch team has been mired in a months-long debate that we're attempting to settle once and for all: What kind of books are best to read during this pandemic? Books that connect you to our current reality? Or ones that help you escape it?</description>

        <name>The Protests Heard 'Round The World</name>
        <description>How did a police killing in Minneapolis lead people thousands of miles across the Atlantic Ocean to pull down the statue of a slave trader who's been dead for nearly three centuries? On this episode, we're going to the city of Bristol to tell the surprising story.</description>

        <name>The Kids Are All Right</name>
        <description>Adults often find it really hard to talk about race. But kids? Maybe not so much. NPR received more than 2,000 entries in this year's Student Podcast Challenge, and we heard from young people all over the country about how they're thinking about race and identity in these trying times.</description>

        <description>Matilda Crawford. Sallie Bell. Carrie Jones. Dora Jones. Orphelia Turner. Sarah A. Collier. In 1881, these six Black women brought the city of Atlanta to a complete standstill by going on strike. The strategies they used in their fight for better working conditions have implications for future generations of organizers — and resonances with the professional sports strikes happening today.</description>

        <description>How was the the richest and most powerful country in the world laid low by a virus only nanometers in size? Ed Yong, a science reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, says it's the inequities that have been with us for generations that made our body politic such opportunistic targets.</description>

On this episode, "Through the Looking Glass," host Vann R. Newkirk II looks at the way the media distorted what was happening in New Orleans in the days after the storm, scapegoating Black people for the devastation they were subjected to.</description>

        <name>The Long, Bloody Strike For Ethnic Studies</name>
        <description>The largest public university system in the country, the Cal State system, just announced a new graduation requirement: students must take an ethnic studies or social justice course. But ethnic studies might not even exist if it weren't for some students at a small commuter college in San Francisco. Fifty years ago, they went on strike — and while their bloody, bitter standoff has been largely forgotten, it forever changed higher education in the United States.</description>

        <name>One Korean American's Reckoning</name>
        <description>At a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles, a young Korean American man named Edmond Hong decided to grab a megaphone. Addressing other Asian Americans in the crowd, he described the need to stop being quiet and complacent in the fight against racism. On this episode, we talk to Edmond about why he decided to speak out. And we check in with a historian about why so many people mistakenly believe that Asian Americans aren't political.</description>

        <name>Un-HolyLand? An Arab Muslim Reckoning With Racism</name>

        <name>Remembering The 'Divine Diahann Carroll'</name>
        <description>On what would have been Diahann Carroll's 85th birthday, we're celebrating the legacy of the actress, model and singer. Reporter Sonari Glinton went to her estate sale and took a tour of some of the objects that represent important moments in Ms. Carroll's life. And because Diahann Carroll achieved so many firsts, the exhibit was more like a civil rights exhibit than an auction.</description>

        <name>What's In A 'Karen'?</name>
        <description>"Karen" has become cultural shorthand for a white woman who wields her race as a cudgel. And look, we all love to hate a good Karen. But where did this archetype come from? What will the next iteration of Karen be? And what are we missing by focusing on the Karens of the world?</description>

        <name>An Immune System</name>
        <description>While it's &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; possible to win a civil lawsuit against police officers for wrongdoing, there's a reason it almost never happens: a legal technicality called qualified immunity. On this episode, we look at how a law meant to protect Black people from racist violence gave way to a legal doctrine that many people see as the biggest obstacle to police reform.</description>

        <name>We Aren't Who We Think We Are</name>
        <description>Every family has a myth about who they are and where they came from. And there are a lot of reasons people tell these stories. Sometimes it's to make your family seem like they were part of an important historical event. Other times, it's to hide something that is too painful to talk about. That last point can be especially true for African American families.</description>

        <name>They Don't Say Our Names Enough</name>
        <description>This year, Pride Month intersects with a surge of protests against racism and police brutality.

        <description>In her new book, &lt;em&gt;The Undocumented Americans&lt;/em&gt;, Karla Cornejo Villavicencio writes about delivery men, housekeepers, and day laborers — the undocumented immigrants who are often ignored while the media focuses its attention on Dreamers. "I wanted to learn about them as the weirdos we all are outside of our jobs," she writes.</description>

        <description>When the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that DACA could remain in place, recipient Miriam Gonzalez was relieved.

        <name>Why Now, White People?</name>
        <description>The video is horrific, and the brutality is stark. But that was the case in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014 and Minnesota in 2016. This time, though, white people are out in the streets in big numbers, and books such as "So You Want to Talk About Race" and "How to Be an Antiracist" top the bestseller lists. So we asked some white people: What's different this time?</description>

        <description>The haphazard response to Hurricane Maria has underscored the tricky, in-between space that Puerto Ricans occupy. They're U.S. citizens — although nearly half of the country doesn't know that. But those who live in Puerto Rico don't enjoy many of the same privileges as citizens on the mainland. In this week's episode, Shereen travels to one of the most Puerto Rican enclaves in the country to explore the fraught relationship Puerto Ricans have with their American-ness.</description>

Why did Eudocia's story hit such a raw nerve in the U.S. and the Philippines? Shereen and Gene talk to Vicente Rafael, a professor who has studied and written about the practice in his native Philippines. We also hear from Lydia Catina Amaya, a Filipina who was a katulong in the Philippines and the United States. And we talk to Melissa Tizon, the author's widow.

For this episode, he spoke to key players to understand why hundreds of churches are ready to start a public fight with the current administration to prevent deportations of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. He also looks at why the movement has to wrestle with important questions: Who controls the story and the message? How much say does an individual or family have in how a sanctuary church leverages their story? Adrian also has a candid talk with Jeanette Vizguerra, who is living inside a Colorado church, as she fights a legal deportation battle. It could be years before she is able to step outside the church. As Adrian reports, the decisions, intentions and relationships complicate the work of sanctuary churches.</description>

        <name>In Search Of Puerto Rican Identity In Small-Town America</name>
        <description>Puerto Ricans are migrants not immigrants, Spanish and English, domestic yet foreign — as we like to say on Code Switch, it's complicated. A hundred years ago this week, Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens by law with the passing of the Jones Act. Since then, they've had a complicated and fraught relationship with what it means to be American. Shereen traveled to Holyoke, Massachusetts to explore what the Jones Act has meant to Puerto Rican identity on stateside in the last century. Holyoke has the highest ration of Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. - nearly 50% of residents there have Puerto Rican heritage. An earlier version of this podcast stated that Myriam Quiñonez has three children. She has two.</description>

        <description>Shereen and Gene are joined by Code Switch's own Adrian Florido to revisit a conversation about how advocates are challenging the narrative of the "good" or "bad" immigrant. Adrian previously reported on what happens when advocates try to champion an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of a crime. For many people, "DREAMers," were considered the most sympathetic characters in the immigration reform drama. But a new administration is in the White House, and what was once a very complicated landscape is changing. Later, economist Ike Brannon from the CATO Institute joins the conversation.</description>

We check in with poet Kevin Young to find out why chitlins will always grace his table. And restaurateur Genevieve Villamora joins Gene and Shereen to talk about dinuguan ... a traditional Filipino pork stew with strong flavors (made with pig's blood).

        <name>Nate Parker's Past, His Present, And The Future Of "The Birth of A Nation"</name>
        <description>Actor Nate Parker is the center of a lot attention these days because of his upcoming movie The Birth of A Nation. Parker wrote, directed and stars as Nat Turner, leader of an historic 1831 slave rebellion in Virginia. Last winter, Parker won a multi-million dollar distribution deal for the movie at the Sundance Film Festival. As the anticipation grows for the film's release, a chapter from Parker's college past has come under scrutiny. He was charged and later acquitted in a rape trial as a student-athlete at Penn State. Code Switch's Karen Grigsby Bates moderates a conversation about how Parker's past and his responses in the present may affect what some already consider an important motion picture. Karen is joined by Gillian White, senior associate editor at The Atlantic, Michael Arceneaux, a columnist for Complex magazine, and Goldie Taylor, an editor-at-large of The Daily Beast.</description>

        <name>Struggling School, Or Sanctuary?</name>

Shereen's reporting, along with that of producer Chris Benderev, was originally produced for the NPR podcast Embedded.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
setup and 
punchline

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist is luo li rong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statue doesn’t have big enough titties to have been made by a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’ve reblogged this before but the schadenfreude is too delicious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the statue is called 

&lt;i&gt;La mélodie oubliée (The Forgotten Melody). &lt;/i&gt;Luo Li Rong also painted it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="933" data-orig-width="700"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8c249435fc5ae5f22e306be7431b4446/tumblr_inline_p4drnbEuX01rrrdzi_540.jpg" data-orig-height="933" data-orig-width="700"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here she and the statue are in a more formal setting (museum or art show, I can’t tell):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="872"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5af533afe946cb66742c81ff37f0a659/tumblr_inline_p4drp1YrEf1rrrdzi_540.jpg" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="872"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dork ass losers”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=""&gt;That beautiful statue started from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="743" data-orig-width="600"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c9d26a808a914b5a4cf9354a57db718a/tumblr_inline_pcakq4yPuw1s1k2ay_540.jpg" data-orig-height="743" data-orig-width="600"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Luo Lirong graduated from 
China Central Academy Of Fine Arts. She’s a very talented artist. More of her works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1115" data-orig-width="690"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a79c1b35ff3fdcc4208177b86f374cf/tumblr_inline_pcakspmfAL1s1k2ay_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1115" data-orig-width="690"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1052" data-orig-width="690"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/976da19d6d0b8d728c159e671e49f15c/tumblr_inline_pcaksu9LHQ1s1k2ay_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1052" data-orig-width="690"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1240" data-orig-width="671"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/830ea2c67cd0ec9df39def7e02bb8e51/tumblr_inline_pcaksyLUZ41s1k2ay_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1240" data-orig-width="671"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful. Extraordinary talent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow her on Instagram luo_li_rong_art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one, I’ve never seen it with paint and it’s somehow even better. As are her other works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not only that it ‘doesn’t have big enough titties’ but it shows natural body proportions and shapes. Breasts are not upright flying balloons. Waist is of someone with bones. Tummy is of someone with intestines. Legs are that of a thin person, but not sticks attached to a butt. The thighs touch, the shape is not ‘lithe perfect’. The hips have a bit of an uneven curve to them. This is a woman statue that looks like a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amentian.com/post/vJW4" title="Read more"&gt;TIL that one-third of humanity (including 60% of Europeans and 80% of North Americans) live in such light polluted areas that the Milky Way is not visible at night.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href="http://ift.tt/2cWbFNZ"&gt;ift.tt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i read this and i was like ‘well duh. no one sees the milky way at night.’ and then i thought about for another minute and then i realised ‘wait… you’re supposed to? some people can see the milky way?’ and now i’m struggling to come to terms with the fact that i’ve literally never seen the milky way and in some countries you can. like all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing the Milky Way in Hawaii and it being hella normal and then I moved to San Fran and was hell disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can kinda-see-it-a-wee-bit on a clear night from my house, but the first time I saw it properly from the coast I was &lt;i&gt;shook&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have now lived on two islands with telescopes, so the light pollution is kept to a minimum, and I feel like people often have no idea what the night sky is supposed to look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I got to go on one of our runs to more rural shelters to help relieve overcrowding there. We ended up bringing back 21 kittens and 10 dogs. So fun day. But this morning, while I was getting stuff together in preparation for the 90 minute drive…. This happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0bc9284beb85c8ffb09af802c8033a34/tumblr_inline_opmczmqqUc1tdmmeu_540.jpg" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excuse you Tiniest Opossum, but you are NOT allowed to escape through the front bars of the cat carrier we were housing you in. I’m going to put you back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ffd7299b65f095e1b2daad3c23e2d8e0/tumblr_inline_opmd3hkXNN1tdmmeu_540.jpg" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p style=""&gt;“NO!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=""&gt;I am going to catch you and put you back and you have no say in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b1f787dc2b97b76312d79d093f197fc/tumblr_inline_opmd4m1ExH1tdmmeu_540.jpg" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“NO!” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catching you and putting you back now.&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3725f5cf237a29b48830181a507cec94/tumblr_inline_opmd6sup471tdmmeu_540.jpg" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;“NOOOOOO!”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaand back you go. Let go of the purple towel and go in the cardboard box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ca79ef5551d8106e86a01b53658e3d5e/tumblr_inline_opmd8yz3sa1tdmmeu_540.jpg" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p style=""&gt;“Noooooooooooo!”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days, I just need Tiniest Opossom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Tiniest Opossum time again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone deserves a chance to see this on their dash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing biblical teachings being reversed into conservative teachings is one of the funniest things holy shit. Like this makes it painfully clear that Jesus taught the exact opposite of all these things yet conservatives in the US wanna call themselves “men of god”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;156 Americans tried to draw 10 famous logos from memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alot of these are better than the orignal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Constant Entity: Target &lt;/p&gt;

It’s almost like a ‘60s vintage design that was forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I recognize some of these as being actual, old logos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;oh my goodness, one of dian fossey’s first close up observations with gorillas happened when she was trying to climb a tree to see them better, but &lt;i&gt;so badly&lt;/i&gt; that by the time she’d gotten up the entire group had come out of hiding to look at her: “Nearly all members of the group had totally exposed themselves, forgetting about hiding coyly behind foliage screens because it was obvious to them that the observer had been distracted by tree-climbing problems, an activity they could understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello, fellow apes&lt;/p&gt;

        <name>Is Trump Really That Racist?</name>
        <description>We know his rhetoric has been described as boundary breaking when it comes to race. But U.S. presidents have been enacting racist policies forever. So as President Trump wraps up his first (and maybe only) term in office, we're asking: In terms of racism, how does he stack up to others when it comes to both words and deeds?</description>

        <name>Let's Talk About Kamala Harris</name>
        <description>The VP candidate's biography and heritage allow people to project all kinds of ideas onto her, and to see what they want to see. But Kamala Harris's identity is a very important lens into not just her own politics, but also Black politics around crime and punishment more broadly. </description>

        <name>Hip-Hop, Mass Incarceration, And A Conspiracy Theory For The Ages</name>
        <description>Why are hip-hop and mass incarceration so entangled in the U.S.? That's the question that our play cousins at NPR Music, Sidney Madden and Rodney Carmichael, set out to answer on &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510357/louder-than-a-riot"&gt;their brand new podcast, &lt;em&gt;Louder Than a Riot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

        <name>A Treaty Right For Cherokee Representation</name>
        <description>On this week's episode of Code Switch, we talk about the relevance of a 200 year old treaty — one that most Americans don't know that much about, but should. It's a treaty that led to the Trail of Tears, but also secured a tenuous promise.</description>

        <name>A New Look For The Fashion Industry?</name>
        <description>Fall is the time for glossy fashion magazines, full of dazzling looks and the seasons hottest looks. But this year, we noticed something unusual: The covers of a bunch of major magazines fashion magazines featured Black folks. So we called up fashion critic Robin Givhan to talk about fashion's racial reckoning...and how long before it goes out of style.</description>

        <name>Is It Time To Say R.I.P. To 'POC'?</name>
        <description>Suffice it to say, we use the term "POC" a lot on Code Switch. But critiques of the initialism — and the popularization of the term "BIPOC" — caused us to ask: Should we retire POC? Or is there use in it yet?</description>

        <name>Battle Of The Books</name>
        <description>The Code Switch team has been mired in a months-long debate that we're attempting to settle once and for all: What kind of books are best to read during this pandemic? Books that connect you to our current reality? Or ones that help you escape it?</description>

        <name>The Protests Heard 'Round The World</name>
        <description>How did a police killing in Minneapolis lead people thousands of miles across the Atlantic Ocean to pull down the statue of a slave trader who's been dead for nearly three centuries? On this episode, we're going to the city of Bristol to tell the surprising story.</description>

        <name>The Kids Are All Right</name>
        <description>Adults often find it really hard to talk about race. But kids? Maybe not so much. NPR received more than 2,000 entries in this year's Student Podcast Challenge, and we heard from young people all over the country about how they're thinking about race and identity in these trying times.</description>

        <name>Balls And Strikes</name>
        <description>Matilda Crawford. Sallie Bell. Carrie Jones. Dora Jones. Orphelia Turner. Sarah A. Collier. In 1881, these six Black women brought the city of Atlanta to a complete standstill by going on strike. The strategies they used in their fight for better working conditions have implications for future generations of organizers — and resonances with the professional sports strikes happening today.</description>

        <description>How was the the richest and most powerful country in the world laid low by a virus only nanometers in size? Ed Yong, a science reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, says it's the inequities that have been with us for generations that made our body politic such opportunistic targets.</description>

We help our listeners understand how race and and its evil play cousin, racism, affect how we make friends, keep friends, and deal with friend breakups.

        <description>It's hurricane season, so this week, we're bringing you a bonus episode, from &lt;em&gt;the Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;'s Floodlines podcast. On this episode, "Through the Looking Glass," host Vann R. Newkirk II looks at the way the media distorted what was happening in New Orleans in the days after the storm, scapegoating Black people for the devastation they were subjected to.</description>

        <name>The Long, Bloody Strike For Ethnic Studies</name>
        <description>The largest public university system in the country, the Cal State system, just announced a new graduation requirement: students must take an ethnic studies or social justice course. But ethnic studies might not even exist if it weren't for some students at a small commuter college in San Francisco. Fifty years ago, they went on strike — and while their bloody, bitter standoff has been largely forgotten, it forever changed higher education in the United States.</description>

        <name>One Korean American's Reckoning</name>
        <description>At a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles, a young Korean American man named Edmond Hong decided to grab a megaphone. Addressing other Asian Americans in the crowd, he described the need to stop being quiet and complacent in the fight against racism. On this episode, we talk to Edmond about why he decided to speak out. And we check in with a historian about why so many people mistakenly believe that Asian Americans aren't political.</description>

        <name>Remembering The 'Divine Diahann Carroll'</name>
        <description>On what would have been Diahann Carroll's 85th birthday, we're celebrating the legacy of the actress, model and singer. Reporter Sonari Glinton went to her estate sale and took a tour of some of the objects that represent important moments in Ms. Carroll's life. And because Diahann Carroll achieved so many firsts, the exhibit was more like a civil rights exhibit than an auction.</description>

        <name>What's In A 'Karen'?</name>
        <description>"Karen" has become cultural shorthand for a white woman who wields her race as a cudgel. And look, we all love to hate a good Karen. But where did this archetype come from? What will the next iteration of Karen be? And what are we missing by focusing on the Karens of the world?</description>

        <name>An Immune System</name>
        <description>While it's &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; possible to win a civil lawsuit against police officers for wrongdoing, there's a reason it almost never happens: a legal technicality called qualified immunity. On this episode, we look at how a law meant to protect Black people from racist violence gave way to a legal doctrine that many people see as the biggest obstacle to police reform.</description>

        <description>Every family has a myth about who they are and where they came from. And there are a lot of reasons people tell these stories. Sometimes it's to make your family seem like they were part of an important historical event. Other times, it's to hide something that is too painful to talk about. That last point can be especially true for African American families.</description>

For this episode, he spoke to key players to understand why hundreds of churches are ready to start a public fight with the current administration to prevent deportations of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. He also looks at why the movement has to wrestle with important questions: Who controls the story and the message? How much say does an individual or family have in how a sanctuary church leverages their story? Adrian also has a candid talk with Jeanette Vizguerra, who is living inside a Colorado church, as she fights a legal deportation battle. It could be years before she is able to step outside the church. As Adrian reports, the decisions, intentions and relationships complicate the work of sanctuary churches.</description>

        <name>In Search Of Puerto Rican Identity In Small-Town America</name>
        <description>Puerto Ricans are migrants not immigrants, Spanish and English, domestic yet foreign — as we like to say on Code Switch, it's complicated. A hundred years ago this week, Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens by law with the passing of the Jones Act. Since then, they've had a complicated and fraught relationship with what it means to be American. Shereen traveled to Holyoke, Massachusetts to explore what the Jones Act has meant to Puerto Rican identity on stateside in the last century. Holyoke has the highest ration of Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. - nearly 50% of residents there have Puerto Rican heritage. An earlier version of this podcast stated that Myriam Quiñonez has three children. She has two.</description>

        <description>Shereen and Gene are joined by Code Switch's own Adrian Florido to revisit a conversation about how advocates are challenging the narrative of the "good" or "bad" immigrant. Adrian previously reported on what happens when advocates try to champion an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of a crime. For many people, "DREAMers," were considered the most sympathetic characters in the immigration reform drama. But a new administration is in the White House, and what was once a very complicated landscape is changing. Later, economist Ike Brannon from the CATO Institute joins the conversation.</description>
