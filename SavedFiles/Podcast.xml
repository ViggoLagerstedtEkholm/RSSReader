        <Description>Robert Hansen owned and operated a successful bakery in Anchorage, Alaska in the 1970s and 80s, selling donuts and danishes to everyone in town. He was a well-known and well-respected member of the business community, living in a nice home in the suburbs with his wife and two children. In his spare time, he liked to fly his plane to the remote area around the Knik River and hunt for wolves and caribou and other large game. But sometimes the wild animals just weren’t enough. He needed something else to hunt, to chase along the river flats, to stalk and kill.

        <Name>MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF: Rey Rivera</Name>
        <Description>In 2006 Rey Rivera was found dead at the Belvedere Hotel in Baltimore. Did he die by suicide, or was something more sinister at play?
Following the release of this episode, representatives of Porter Stansberry contacted Crime Junkie to inform us of information regarding Rey Rivera’s case that had not yet been made public, and we want to alert our listeners to that information for the sake of being exhaustive. Not only did Porter Stansberry offer a reward to find Rey, he also hired a private detective to lead the search for Rey. Although previously reported accounts suggested that Porter did not cooperate with police, this appears not to have been correct. Porter did urge all of his employees and even all of his company’s clients to contact the police with any information about Rey’s whereabouts. After Rey’s body was found, Porter never issued a gag order telling employees not to help the police. Porter in fact fully cooperated with the Police after Rey’s body was found, including being interviewed by the lead detective in the case on June 23rd 2006.

        <Description>During spring break of 1975, Shelia &amp; Kate Lyon went missing from a shopping center near their home and for almost 40 years no one knew what happened to them. Over the years horrible men would come into focus as suspects. Men who took the lives of 10-year-old Amanda Ray, 5-year-old Neely Smith, and 15-year-old Kathy Beatty. But it wasn't until a cold case investigator came across a single old report from 1975 (a report that had been there all along) that the case would finally be solved and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Lyon would finally have answers about what happened to their daughters.

        <Name>INFAMOUS: Alice Crimmins</Name>
        <Description>Long before Casey Anthony, there was another mother America loved to hate... Alice Crimmins. When her children went missing from their room one summer night, the police and the press were quick to point the finger at the "sex-crazed" mother. At the start of the women's lib movement, Alice stood for everything that threatened the status quo of how a wife and mother should behave. But over 50 years later we can re-examine the case and her multiple trials to see if there really was a case against Alice or if she was the victim of a witch hunt.

        <Name>SERIAL KILLER: The Claremont Killer</Name>
        <Description>Since 1996, people in Claremont had been looking over their shoulders when they go out for a night on the town. Over the span of a few years, three girls were taken from the same place in nearly identical fashions. Many years later, those crimes would be connected to other attacks dating back to 1988. And somehow, in 2016, a man was arrested for these crimes... But we still don't know exactly how police got his name.

        <Description>On November 20, 2012, Sage Smith left her home at 5:30 for a date. She was seen alone at 6:30 talking to someone on the phone and then possibly sighted one more time at 7:00 at a cafe, again alone. Her father and friends were advocates and attempted to investigate her disappearance on their own, but ended up in the same place where the police ended up. At a dead end. No one has seen her since and police are still looking to speak with the man she last communicated with that day.

        <Name>SERIAL KILLER: The Green River Killer</Name>
        <Description>Through the 80's &amp; 90's, women in the state of Washington were turning up dead. First, along the Green River, then in other clusters throughout the state and even into Portland, Oregon. Not only had these women been murdered but their killer would re-visit their corpses and sexually assault them multiple times until their corpses were fully decomposed and consumed by maggots. A man named Gary Ridgeway had been pointed out by a number of witnesses as being the Green River Killer but police were unable to make an arrest until DNA connected him to four crime scenes in 2001 – two decades and at least 49 victims later.

        <Name>ADNAN: What Serial Didn't Tell You</Name>
        <Description>Hundreds of millions of people tuned into Serial season one back in 2014. Sarah Koenig told us all about the story of 18-year-old high school senior Hae Min Lee who disappeared on January 13th, 1999. Hae's body was later found in Leakin Park, and not too long after the discovery of her body, police zeroed in on their prime suspect: Adnan Syed. Sarah took us all through 12 episodes of "Did he or didn't he?" and many of us ended the season with more questions than answers. But did you know that Serial was just the beginning and there was so much that Sarah never covered? If you listened to Serial season one, you must listen to this single episode that sums up the top four points Serial didn't tell you, but you need to know before you decide whether or not you think Adnan is guilty. We won't be re-covering the Serial story - we jump in assuming you already know it. So, if you haven't listened yet, check out the first season of Serial.

        <Description>What makes a seemingly normal family man snap, murder his entire family, and assume a new identity in Mexico? Christian Longo was a husband, and father of three kids, who moved his family to Oregon to escape legal and money trouble he had accrued back in Michigan. But the new start didn't take away the pressure of supporting a family on a part-time, minimum wage income. One December day, Christian's family is found in the most horrific ways and Christian is nowhere to be found. The prosecution and the public seem pretty clear on what took place the day the Longo family died, but Christian's surprise story after he goes to trial is just his final way of disgracing his family.

        <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Provosts, a family of sugar-cane farmers in Louisiana, had worked the same land for generations. When it became harder and harder to keep hold of that land, June Provost and his wife, Angie, didn’t know why — and then a phone call changed their understanding of everything. In the finale of “1619,” we hear the rest of June and Angie’s story, and its echoes in a past case that led to the largest civil rights settlement in American history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today’s episode: June and Angie Provost; Adizah Eghan and Annie Brown, producers for “1619”; and Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of history, race and public policy at Harvard University and the author of “The Condemnation of Blackness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“1619” is a New York Times audio series hosted by Nikole Hannah-Jones.

Join this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, Michael Knowles, and Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing, as they get to the bottom of these questions and more.

        <Name>The Truth About America: Where Do We Go From Here?</Name>
        <Description>The truth about America has been obscured and deleted by the far American Left. In this collection of Sunday Special highlights, featured guests including Tucker Carlson, Nikki Haley, and Mark Levin break down the truth about America's history, philosophy and culture. We discuss how we got to this point - and where we go from here if we want to take back the country. 
 
The topics in this video are also covered extensively in my new book, "How To Destroy America in Three Easy Steps." It's crushing sales records and coming in at the top of every bestseller chart, so if you want an antidote to divisive books like "White Fragility" and "How To Be An Antiracist," pick up your copy here: https://utm.io/uHcC

        <Description>The Berlin Airlift. The Korean War. The Cuban Missile Crisis. The Space Race. Vietnam. Detente. Reagan. Solidarity. Gorbachev. The tales of these earth-shaking milestones have been always been told as a series of individual events, completely apart from each other. But they were not individual events; they were individual threads in the tapestry of the Apocalypse That Didn’t Happen. And because they were all part of the same ongoing story, they need to be treated that way. Check out the new 12-part podcast series, "The Cold War: What We Saw."
