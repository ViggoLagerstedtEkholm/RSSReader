        <Description>What does it take to be a leader at any level? Join me every Monday on the Dare to Lead podcast as I unpack the skill-sets of courage-building, and talk to as many change-makers, culture-shifters, and troublemakers as possible. Together, we’ll have conversations that help us show up, step up, and dare to lead.

In this first solo episode, I talk about my passion for this work, what we’ve been learning about courageous leadership and skill building, and the differences between armored and daring leadership.

        <Description>Burnout. We're all experiencing it and we're all desperate for a way through it. In this episode, I talk to Drs.

        <Name>Brené with Jason Sudeikis &amp; Brendan Hunt on Ted Lasso</Name>
        <Description>As the self-appointed president of the TLFC (Ted Lasso Fan Club), it was a blast to talk to Jason Sudeikis, the co-creator, writer, and executive producer who plays Ted Lasso, and Brendan Hunt, the co-creator and writer who plays Coach Beard on the Apple TV+ hit series. The show follows the adventures of a small-time college football coach from Kansas hired to coach a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience coaching soccer. We talk about the show's interesting origin story, writers' room inspirations, and why intention is critical to the creative process. It's a fun conversation about a show that is unapologetically awkward, brave, and kind.</Description>

        <Description>The Most Rev. Michael Curry is Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church, and on this episode, we talk about love. Messy, hard, complicated love. I ask him how we can transcend fear in a scarcity-based culture and what we can learn from those who came before us. We also talk about the church, how to develop beloved community, and the scrappy, gritty, work of love that is my definition of faith. Plus, Bishop Curry shares his playlist with one song that I really didn’t expect.</Description>

        <Description>In this episode, researcher and professor Dr. Scott Sonenshein and I talk about the art and science of being scrappy, why outsiders are sometimes better than experts, and why comparison is truly the thief of joy. This book turned things upside down for me - in the best way. I hope the conversation does the same for you.</Description>

        <Name>Brené on Ask Me Anything, Part 2 of 2</Name>
        <Description>We received so many thoughtful and tough AMA questions from listeners that it took us two episodes to cover the most popular topics. In Part 2, I unpack one of the most asked questions: How do parents build shame resilience in our children? I'm also answering another popular question: Are there TV series and/or films that I think do a great job of accurately capturing emotions and the human experience? While there are SO many that do that well, I share a few of my current favorites.</Description>

        <Name>Brené on Ask Me Anything, Part 1 of 2</Name>
        <Description>I said, “Ask Me Anything,” and the Unlocking Us community came through with the tough questions. To be honest, I thought I’d get some easy, fun ones—but no, all deep-end questions. In fact, we had hundreds and hundreds of tough, smart, thoughtful questions submitted, and in today’s episode I answer five of them. We cover ‘fake news,’ disappointment vs self-pity, religion and shame, when something is shame-worthy, and we’re just getting started.</Description>

        <Name>Brené on Shame and Accountability</Name>
        <Description>In today’s solo episode, I share my thoughts about why accountability is a prerequisite for change, and why we need to get our heads and hearts around the difference between being held accountable for racism and feeling shame, and being shamed. I share my personal stories of being held accountable and holding myself accountable, as well as my strategies for pulling my “thinking brain” back online when I’m experiencing the flight and fight energy fueled by shame.</Description>

        <Description>I'm talking with Judd Apatow, who has directed, produced, and written many of the biggest comedy films and hit TV shows of the last two decades. We look at what's funny, why it's funny, and why laughter creates connection. We also uncover that thin line between humor and grief and what it means to tell the stories of our lives in a way that we recognize ourselves and our shared humanity.</Description>

        <Name>Brené with Reese Witherspoon &amp; Kerry Washington on Little Fires Everywhere</Name>
        <Description>Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington are true creatives and storytellers, working to make timely art that is honest and vulnerable and truth-telling. Here’s part two of my conversation on Little Fires Everywhere. This episode covers how Reese and Kerry worked with a team of other creatives to bring Celeste’s words to life. We talked about the challenges and responsibilities of creating authentic, living, breathing characters with complex internal thoughts. We talked about motherhood and how it connects us, changes us, and changes as it goes. And we talked about creating art that honors ordinary, complicated people from completely different backgrounds, while connecting us all together.</Description>

        <Description>My conversation with Celeste Ng is the first of two episodes on Little Fires Everywhere, where I'll cover the book and the series. We talked about the writing process, the stories that we tell, and the stories that define us. We also covered how our hometowns shape us, how parenting is a shame minefield, and how we all have the power to mourn moments even while we’re in them. Celeste also filled us in on what she thinks about the series and what it felt like watching Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington create a show from her novel. I loved this episode as a reader, as a writer, and as an observer of what it means to be human.</Description>

They’re also partners, fathers, and brothers who believe in connection, love, and the importance of small moments. In this episode we talk about their memoir, Like Brothers, and how so much of what we crave in life comes from straddling the paradoxes inherent in love, creativity, and relationships.</Description>

        <Description>This two-episode special is based on a course that Dr. Harriet Lerner and I did together on her groundbreaking book, “Why Won’t You Apologize?: Healing Big Betrayals and Everyday Hurts.” You can expect authentic, hard conversations (and one helluva role play) about making mistakes, healing hurts, and being brave. Harriet is a friend, mentor, and teacher. Her work has shaped my career and made my life better. During a time of deep uncertainty and anxiety - when many of us have struggled to be our best selves all of the time - apologizing has never been more important.</Description>

In this episode, I talk to Dr. Vivek Murthy, a physician and the 19th Surgeon General of the United States, about loneliness and the physical and emotional toll that social disconnection takes on us.

        <Description>Tarana is a good friend and one of my favorite people on earth. She has been working at the intersection of racial justice and gender equity for nearly three decades, and she started the “Me Too” Movement in 2006.  In 2017, when the #metoo hashtag went viral, Tarana emerged as a global leader in the evolving conversation around sexual violence.
In this episode we talk about how her theory of “empowerment through empathy” is changing the way the world thinks and talks about sexual violence, consent, and social justice. AND, we also talk/cry/laugh about falling in love, running as fast as we can from love, and the perils of sharing a bathroom with the guys we love.</Description>

        <Name>MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF: Rey Rivera</Name>
        <Description>In 2006 Rey Rivera was found dead at the Belvedere Hotel in Baltimore. Did he die by suicide, or was something more sinister at play?
Following the release of this episode, representatives of Porter Stansberry contacted Crime Junkie to inform us of information regarding Rey Rivera’s case that had not yet been made public, and we want to alert our listeners to that information for the sake of being exhaustive. Not only did Porter Stansberry offer a reward to find Rey, he also hired a private detective to lead the search for Rey. Although previously reported accounts suggested that Porter did not cooperate with police, this appears not to have been correct. Porter did urge all of his employees and even all of his company’s clients to contact the police with any information about Rey’s whereabouts. After Rey’s body was found, Porter never issued a gag order telling employees not to help the police. Porter in fact fully cooperated with the Police after Rey’s body was found, including being interviewed by the lead detective in the case on June 23rd 2006.

        <Description>During spring break of 1975, Shelia &amp; Kate Lyon went missing from a shopping center near their home and for almost 40 years no one knew what happened to them.

        <Name>INFAMOUS: Alice Crimmins</Name>
        <Description>Long before Casey Anthony, there was another mother America loved to hate... Alice Crimmins. When her children went missing from their room one summer night, the police and the press were quick to point the finger at the "sex-crazed" mother. At the start of the women's lib movement, Alice stood for everything that threatened the status quo of how a wife and mother should behave. But over 50 years later we can re-examine the case and her multiple trials to see if there really was a case against Alice or if she was the victim of a witch hunt.

        <Name>SERIAL KILLER: The Green River Killer</Name>
        <Description>Through the 80's &amp; 90's, women in the state of Washington were turning up dead. First, along the Green River, then in other clusters throughout the state and even into Portland, Oregon. Not only had these women been murdered but their killer would re-visit their corpses and sexually assault them multiple times until their corpses were fully decomposed and consumed by maggots. A man named Gary Ridgeway had been pointed out by a number of witnesses as being the Green River Killer but police were unable to make an arrest until DNA connected him to four crime scenes in 2001 – two decades and at least 49 victims later.

        <Name>ADNAN: What Serial Didn't Tell You</Name>
        <Description>Hundreds of millions of people tuned into Serial season one back in 2014. Sarah Koenig told us all about the story of 18-year-old high school senior Hae Min Lee who disappeared on January 13th, 1999. Hae's body was later found in Leakin Park, and not too long after the discovery of her body, police zeroed in on their prime suspect: Adnan Syed. Sarah took us all through 12 episodes of "Did he or didn't he?" and many of us ended the season with more questions than answers. But did you know that Serial was just the beginning and there was so much that Sarah never covered? If you listened to Serial season one, you must listen to this single episode that sums up the top four points Serial didn't tell you, but you need to know before you decide whether or not you think Adnan is guilty. We won't be re-covering the Serial story - we jump in assuming you already know it. So, if you haven't listened yet, check out the first season of Serial.

        <Description>What makes a seemingly normal family man snap, murder his entire family, and assume a new identity in Mexico? Christian Longo was a husband, and father of three kids, who moved his family to Oregon to escape legal and money trouble he had accrued back in Michigan. But the new start didn't take away the pressure of supporting a family on a part-time, minimum wage income. One December day, Christian's family is found in the most horrific ways and Christian is nowhere to be found. The prosecution and the public seem pretty clear on what took place the day the Longo family died, but Christian's surprise story after he goes to trial is just his final way of disgracing his family.

        <Name>Shelby Steele | The Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special Ep. 105</Name>
        <Description>Author, columnist, and documentarian Shelby Steele has been a leading scholar on race in the nation for decades. A strong advocate for the civil rights movement of the 1960s, Steele promotes individual liberty and freedom. However, modern racial movements and policies, he says, have done more harm than good for the cause of equality. Increasing dependence on the government has undermined the cause of liberty. Steele, along with his son Eli, have recently released a new documentary, “What Killed Michael Brown?”, an investigation into the 2014 Ferguson, Missouri shooting, just as George Floyd’s death rocked the nation. The film has been labeled as controversial in some unexpected ways. Shelby joined the show today to share the full story, as well as discuss the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and organization, and the reason President Trump and his supporters are so often labeled as racist.

        <Description>The Berlin Airlift. The Korean War. The Cuban Missile Crisis. The Space Race. Vietnam. Detente. Reagan. Solidarity. Gorbachev. The tales of these earth-shaking milestones have been always been told as a series of individual events, completely apart from each other. But they were not individual events; they were individual threads in the tapestry of the Apocalypse That Didn’t Happen. And because they were all part of the same ongoing story, they need to be treated that way. Check out the new 12-part podcast series, "The Cold War: What We Saw."
