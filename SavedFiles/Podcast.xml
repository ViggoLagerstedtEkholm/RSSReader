        <name>Så hittar du Ekots korta sändningar</name>
        <description>Här finns nu Ekots längre nyhetssändningar med en komplett nyhetsuppdatering fyra gånger per dygn. Vi har också nyhetsuppdateringar varje timme. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; På den här sidan kommer du från och med nu få en komplett bild av nyhetsläget fyra gånger per dygn.
Om du vill ha snabba nyhetsuppdateringar varje timme hittar du det om du istället besöker Nyhetsuppdatering från Ekot, eller söker på det i SR Play och där poddar finns.
Ett tips är också Toppnyheter som finns högst upp i appen SR Play. Det är Sveriges Radios ständigt uppdaterade nyhetsspellista som ger en komplett bild av nyhetsläget just nu.
